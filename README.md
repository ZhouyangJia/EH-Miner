# EH-Miner
Mining Error-Handling Bugs without Error Specification Input

---

### Introduction
*EH-Miner* is a bug detection tool for error-handling bugs. Existing tools of detecting error-handling bugs require error specifications as input. Manually generating error specifications is error-prone and tedious. The accuracy of automatically mined error specifications is inadequate. We design *EH-Miner*, a novel and practical tool that can automatically detect error-handling bugs without the need for error specifications.
